# Simutils implements essential utils functions for estimating parameters from real data, simulating and evaluating the simulated single-cell RNA-seq datastets.

Simutils contains many useful utils functions to establish the standard
pipeline for defining a simulation method, preprocessing reference
datasets with specific requirements, preparing important files for
special simulators, evaluating the performance of different simulation
methods and so on.

## Installation

You can install the development version of simutils from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("duohongrui/simutils")
```
